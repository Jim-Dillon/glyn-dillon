                <p>Glyn Dillon’s first solo exhibition, presented by URS + LINLEY, is to be held between the 14th-20th May 2020 at NOHO Studios 46 Great Titchfield St. London W1W 7QA</p>

                <hr>

                <p><em>Glyn Dillon is a multidisciplinary artist who works mainly as a painter and sculptor. Dillon’s practice explores the fantasy and reality or limited spaces, or thresholds, using a kind of innate unconscious and unspecific knowledge. He examines his feelings and how the unexpected loss of his brother has changed his perception. Dillon is interested in the fundamental nature of reality, identity and change, space and time, and more specifically, examining the dyadic relationship he had, and continues to have, with his brother despite his untimely death. His practice tries to understand the grieving process through universal, primal symbols, and archetypes that are the psychic counterpart of instinct. He wants to understand how the narratives he has around death have become established, how they affect him , and how they might develop and change. His work has been influenced by his career in the film industry as a Costume Designer, Storyboard and Concept Artist, as well as the narrative discipline of writing and drawing his award winning graphic novel ‘The Nao of Brown’.</em></p>
