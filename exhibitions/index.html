                <p><em>I am a multidisciplinary artist who works predominately as a painter. My practice currently explores the fantasy and reality of transitional spaces, thresholds or ‘Rubicons’. I'm interested in the fundamental transitory nature of reality, identity, and more specifically, exploring the dyadic relationship I had, and continue to have, with my dead brother Steve Dillon. I have re-created certain works of his in an effort to have some form of dialogue with him, to gain an understanding and a feeling of how it might’ve been to create them originally but also to understand what they might mean now.

                <hr>    

                My brother died in The Walcot Hotel, New York aged just fifty four, the following year I stayed in the same hotel, in the same room he died in. Some of the paintings in ‘Who Am I Now?’ are directly about that experience. I obviously knew he was dead, but a part of me felt if I went to New York and wandered around, visited the bars he liked to frequent, then at some point I’d bump into him. I wasn’t delusional, I knew that wasn’t really possible but a big part of me felt that way. My more attachment based, unconscious, right hemisphere brain was literally still looking for him and I had to go through the rather disappointing process of the hotel room being…. just a hotel room, and not some portal to another dimension.</em></p>
